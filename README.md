# SwiftUIAnimation
SwiftUI Tutorial and References

# OVERVIEW
I recreated the home screens of Twitter and Facebook and a lot of its animations/transitions. This is a work in progress and will be updated for major bugs and UI problems. Ideal device would be iPhone XR or 11. I didn’t test this on other devices since I just wanted to practice. Updates for those will come soon. 

Goal is to share this with the community and be used as reference for future projects. I would also love to get some feedback on better implementations. Hope you guys find this useful.
